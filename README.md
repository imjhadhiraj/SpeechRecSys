# Speech Recognition System

This project is a basic implementation of a speech recognition system that listens for specific voice commands to control actions like "switch on light" and "switch off light". It uses the Web Speech API, which is supported in modern browsers.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you just need a web browser that supports the Web Speech API. Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Firefox) with support for the Web Speech API.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-recognition-system.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd speech-recognition-system
    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Features

- **Voice Commands:** Recognizes simple voice commands such as "switch on light" and "switch off light".
- **Grammar Support:** Defines grammar rules for recognized commands to improve accuracy.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Displays the recognized command and confidence level.

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Click anywhere on the page to start the speech recognition.
3. Speak one of the predefined commands: "switch on light" or "switch off light".
4. The system will process your voice command and display the recognized text and confidence level.
5. If the command is recognized, it will log the action in the console.

## Customization

You can easily customize the commands recognized by the system:

1. Modify the `colors` array to include your desired commands:
    ```javascript
    var colors = ['your command 1', 'your command 2'];
    ```
2. Adjust the corresponding logic in the `onresult` event handler to perform different actions based on the recognized command.

## Browser Compatibility

This project is compatible with modern web browsers that support the Web Speech API, such as:

- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Mozilla Firefox (with some limitations)
 to your needs!
